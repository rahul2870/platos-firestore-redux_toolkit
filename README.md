### TO THE POINT

##### DISADVANTAGE OF NODE-JS FOR PLATOS 
1.) CAN WORK SLOW.
2.) LOT'S OF TIME REQUIREMENT TO SETUP & MANAGE.

##### ADVANTAGE OF NODE-JS FOR PLATOS 
1.) MORE SECURE CONNECTIONS
2.) [IMP] BUSINESS LOGIC IMPLEMENT IN GREAT WAY.
3.) PLATOS HAS 3 CONNECTION I GUSS Partner,Mobile & Admin SO FOR THAT STRONG CONNECTION'S & API'S ( LIKE GRAPHQL ) NEEDED.
4.) BY SEEING FUTURE OF PLATOS, DATABASE SHOULD BE MORE DOABLE THINGS (hard queries,too nested item can be save, etc.... ) WHICH HELP TO KNOW WHAT TYPE OF PEOPLE WHAT KIND OF FOOD NEED AT WHAT TIME etc.. etc..
       

##### FIREBASE 
1.) ( BY THE WAY FIREBASE WAS MY FIRST LOVE BUT AS WE KNOW FIRST LOVE NEVER LASTS ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚ ) EASY TO IMPLEMENT, FUNCIONING, UNDERSTANDING, HOSTING, AUTHENTICATION AND MANY MORE....
BUT BY OTHER TECHNOLOGY PLATOS CAN BE BETTER ( DEPEND UPON NUMBER OF USER DATABASE IF IT IS SMALL THEN FIREBASE PERFECT ).
